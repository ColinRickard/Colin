<!--Hello, maker! Welcome to my Electrate Fuego web design tutorial. I'm glad you found it – for this might be a real intersection on your way to becoming. I (S.J. Quigley) use this document in my Technical Communications classes at the University of Pittsburgh to teach my students a little bit about computer science and something called "electracy." Just follow along with comments like this one, and you'll make a really cool web documemt that not only introduces you to the other people in our classes, but will help you process how different discourse communities in your life have contributed to your arrival in this space, virtual and actual, and also contribute to where you might be going. 

In this doc, you will work through Gregory Ulmer's discourses of career, family, entertainment, community, and schooling (_Internet Invention From Literacy to Electracy_, 2002.) In Ulmer's text, he elides community and schooling into one category, but for our puposes I have separated them. Ulmer's theory of electracy helps makes sense of how we find/construct meaning and connect with others rhetorically in a media rich ecology. Ulmer uses analogy to define electracy, explaining that "electracy is to digital media what literacy is to print." 

You could make this document the easy way--like I once did by using a program called Adobe Spark: https://spark.adobe.com/page/umUY5ROHgANCl/, or you can do a little more work to unconceal, opening up these tools that you use every day, but might not know how they function, yet prove so necessary to how you (re)present yourself and connect with others in virtual spaces. And this last bit is an important point! If we really want to be makers, if we really want to be creative, then we need to understand what our digital tools do, how they work, and consider the implications of their use. Through this process you will alos learn a little bit about computer literacy and computer science. Enough to allow you to build web texts and understand file management. 

So let's cut this thing open – using "tmesis" as the Ancient Greeks would call it – lets "cut" and arrange, tweak, take away and augment...that's how we create! I hope you're excited to use this tool to create a document that will simultaneously help you process your journey and help orient you along the path on which you are headed in your becoming. Before we get going I would like to give a shout-out to my research buddy Shauna Chung, who helped me develop the original Ulmerian framework we will be following in this document. Are you ready to get started?--> 
    
 <!--To get started, you will need to fork my repository from GitHub if you haven't already. If you want to easily publish it on GitHub, I'll give you more information at the end of this document. But for right now, fork, and then download the website to a zip file (or clone it, if you know what that means). Go ahead and put these files in a secure place (folder) where you will be able to find them and organize your other assests like images, pdfs, etcetera. You will also need a text editor like "brackets.io" or "atom.io" or "notepad-plus-plus.org." Open the style.css and index.html documents in the text editor and we can get started building our own electrate experience.--> 

<!--BTW. You can leave these hidden HTML text fields be, or delete them. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--First we will need to do some work in the head of the document. The head organizes important information needed to expalin to browsers how the website will work. Go ahead and change the title of this HTML document below, from "Electrate Fuego" to whatever you want it to be called. Your new text will appear in your browser tab-->
    
<title>Colin Rickard</title>
    
    <!--this next section of code does important work to help different browsers understand what this page should look like on the different kinds of screens.--> 
    
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    
     <!--this code tells the browser to link to the style.css file that controls the appearance of much of your content.--> 
    
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>
  
  
<!--The body of the document houses the content that a user usually sees on a website. We'll be spending most of our time in this section.-->
    
<body>
       
<!-- We'll need to do some more work in this section, but to do so, we'll need to make some changes on your style.css file. Developers refer to this division as a "Hero Block," but we will refer to it as a "Wide Image."  Think carefully about the image you select and how it might serve a sybolic function in your life. Ulmer refers to these kinds of symbolic images as "wide images" in that they often repeat over and over in our lifetime. We will similarly repeat this image at the end of your Electrate Infuego composition to establish a motif in this web document.  

Place a .jpg or .png in the same file folder as this project (hint: simplify the name). You don't need to do anything on this html page, but you'll need to change the background image name on the style.css page to match you image asset.

Now, change the other relevant information in this section, especially if you're not John en Fuego or not majoring in "electracy"-->

      <!--In our first exploration of discourse, we're going to think about the wider characteristics or themes of our field or future career. In academia, we do a lot of work narrowing our interest to arrive at a career or profession, often reducing our field to a level of operation or an act. Instead, I would like you to think more broadly about the "wider themes" you associate with your field or future career and its larger significance in improving our world. Yes--improving the world. Thinking back, where do you see exposure to those same "wider themes" in your own life? Those ah-ha moments, lessons, examples, tools, passions, or qualities that suggested this career path to you? Replace the content between <h2> and </h2> that begins with "Lorem ipsum."-->
    
     <div class="par-centertext">
  <h1>Academic Interest</h1>
    
  <h2>                I am a Junior Environmental Engineering student at the University of Pittsburgh. I discovered my interest in engineering and mechanical systems when I was very young, and I always explored chances to see further into the field.<br><br>

This past summer, I had the opportunity to work as a radiation technician at Austin Master Services in the field of Environmental Engineering. The facility I worked at in Martins Ferry, Ohio was specialized for radiological remediation of naturally occurring radioactive materials. This experience gave me valuable knowledge into complex systems and maintenance, as well as the chance to work closely with the Environmental Safety Engineer onsite.<br><br>

I have experience working in the field on efficiency projects and estimating which helped me gain skills in time management, money management, and documentation. In past summer internships and experiences at Austin Master Services and Global Advanced Metals, I was tasked with taking samples and diluting hazardous kiln dust, raffinate, and filter cake to prepare it for disposal.<br><br>

During my time at Pitt, I have become proficient in excel, Microsoft suite, C coding, MATLAB, Solidworks, AutoCAD. Pitt has given me the opportunity to look for research and explore my interests in engineering. I am always excited to begin new projects and learning new skills. I am looking for opportunities in research and internships in and around Pittsburgh.<br><br>

 I am always intrigued by new experiences and potential industry routes. I hope to use the knowledge I have gained from those experiences to improve my understanding of the field and become a better engineer.</h2>

<div class="par-centertext">
  <h1>Family and Home</h1>
    </div>
    
<!--We will begin this section with a photo grid. Add those beautiful, meaningful "family" and "home" photos (only you can define family) to your project folder, making sure the files end in .jpg or .png and replace/add the names of your assets to the grid below. You can add more photos if you wish, or subtract... see what happens – you have to be playful to find the purpose of things. You may need to adjust the size of your assets to produce the effect you desire. Resizing local files is one way to control the size of images on a website.-->

What about "home." What  does that mean to you? In what ways is it significant in determining where your are going? Replace the content between <h2> and </h2> that says "Lorem ipsum."--> 
    
<div class="par-centertext">
  <h2>My family consists of my parents, an older sister, and a little brother. I grew up in Orwisgburg, PA. Family to me is a sense of knowing that there is someone out there that will always be there for you. It is important to me that I take the time to reach out and visit my family even while being far away.</h2>

<!--Now we are moving into the kinds of media that contributes to your everyday discourse. This might sound weird, but Ulmer argues that media has actually contributed a great deal to who you are as a person, how you language yourself, and even how you move through the world and interact with others. So, let's take some time to explore this discourse area. You have the opportunity to add video content or other significant media content. You might also add images to this section (see the bottom of this sheet for directions on how to add elements) perhaps adding a photo grid like the one you did for the "Family" section. Experiment. You can't break this thing, right? Control Z. Control Z. Control Z... -->

<!--Time to process. How do you use media? What role do certain kinds of media play in your life? How does media serve a social function? In what way might you be "recreating" or "remaking" media in your everyday life? 

FUN FACT: "Lorem ipsum", "Lorem ipsum" was hacked out of Cicero's "De finibus bonorum et malorum," developers made it non-sensical. So while you will probably never write as well as Cicero, you can always improve upon "Lorem ipsum." -->

  <h2>For a long time now, music has been the main form of entertainment that I use. Although I don't play any instruments, music is still a huge part of my life and can help in any situation. I also love TV shows like Parks and Rec, Community, and Cheers. I think that these kinds of forms of entertainment serve an important social function. I can't name how many people I've made better friends with just from discovering the music and TV shows that they like. I kind of feel like being in zoom lectures all day is like a big TV show that the whole class is on. Its even organized like we're all part of the Brady Brunch</h2>

  <h1>Community</h1>

    <!--So what exactly is your community: is it actual? virtual? Where do find your ground, or at least, where do you drop anchor, you drifter, you? While we often think of communities as neighborhoods and clubs and a group of colleagues or friends, you might find community across the frontiers of the dead, and perhaps even with those who have never lived. I'll let you explain. -->
    
    <div class="par-centertext">
  <h2>Community to me can mean a lot of different things depending on the situation. When I'm at work, I feel like I belong to a small community of people who are all working towards the same goal. When I'm in zoom lectures, I feel like everyone in class for the semester is part of a small community where we are all communicating and trying to figure out how to succeed. Community can be a lot more than just the area of the city that you live in, although I am a part of a community like that as  well. It is important for communities of all kinds to work together in hopes of a common good.</h2>

    <div class="par-centertext">   
  <h2>School is very important to me and I have always tried to give my best towards my work. However, coming to Pitt was a difficult transition and things were not easy for the first half of my college career. Since that time, I have come out a better person with a better frame of mind, and I can focus on how Pitt can help me make a good life for myself in the future. I am hoping that Pitt takes me into my field and a job that can support a comfortable lifestyle. Overall, school has not always been easy, but it has always been important in making me a better person.</h2>

<!--The final step in our process will be to ensure that a smaller version of our "hero image," what Ulmer would refer to as our "wide image," repeats at the bottom of our document to better reinforce this motif.  -->
